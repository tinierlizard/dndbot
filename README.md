# dndbot
 This was initially a bot just for DND shenanigans between a couple friends and I, but it's since been changed to a personal client-installable app for Discord that just has a bunch of custom commands I made for fun, and for learnings sake.

 Warning: This was my first attempt at making a user-installable app, and during that process I had to learn a variety of things I had never touched before. As a result, this repository is definitely not my best work, and is something I'll likely recreate in the future in order to improve.
